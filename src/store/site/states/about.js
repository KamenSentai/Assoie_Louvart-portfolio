This was my first time in India, and it became my life‚Äôs strongest experience. I discovered new culture and incredible people. It was a real chance for me to work in another country in a different environment. I dream of achieving another such wonderful experience ! My second internship was in Paris at ET SI, also as Design Intern, for 6 months. I worked for many brands during which time I was able to develop my design skills in graphic design, photography and branding.',
